# Hi, I'm Rahul Kadam.

I am an **ML Systems Engineer** focused on the infrastructure layer of AI. I bridge the gap between model architecture and hardware constraints, optimizing for training latency, memory efficiency, and scale.

### 🔭 Engineering Focus
*   **Distributed Training:** Architecting multi-GPU training loops using **DeepSpeed (ZeRO)** and **PyTorch DDP**.
*   **High-Performance Computing:** Building low-level **C++** simulators and optimizing kernels for **CUDA**.
*   **Production MLOps:** Contributor to **Opik** (Open Source), building evaluation pipelines with CI/CD integration.

### 🚀 Highlighted Projects
